Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)
==========================================

What is MCP?
-----------

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how applications interact with large language models (LLMs). It allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction.

MCP lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions.

MCP allows models to:

1. **Request information** from the application through resources
2. **Take actions** through function calling with tools
3. **Generate structured prompts** for specific use cases

About FastMCP
------------

FastMCP is a high-level, Pythonic interface for building MCP servers. Originally developed as a standalone project, it has now been integrated into the official MCP Python SDK. FastMCP provides a developer-friendly way to create MCP servers with minimal boilerplate.

Key features of FastMCP:

- **Simple decorators** for defining resources, tools, and prompts
- **Automatic type handling** for Python objects, Pydantic models, and images
- **Built-in development tools** for testing and debugging
- **Claude Desktop integration** for seamless deployment

Here's a minimal example:

.. code-block:: python

   from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

   mcp = FastMCP("Demo ðŸš€")

   @mcp.tool()
   def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
       """Add two numbers"""
       return a + b

Core Concepts
------------

MCP defines several core primitives:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 50

   * - Primitive
     - Who Controls
     - Description
   * - Resources
     - Application
     - Contextual data managed by the client application. Models can request resources to get information (files, API data, etc.).
   * - Tools
     - Model
     - Functions exposed to the LLM to take actions. Models can call tools to perform computations or produce side effects.
   * - Prompts
     - User
     - Interactive templates invoked by user choice. Users choose prompts from options provided by the application.
   * - Images
     - Application
     - Visual data that can be shared with or generated by models.
   * - Context
     - Application
     - Access to MCP capabilities within tools and resources.

Benefits of MCP
--------------

* **Reliability**: Models can request exactly what they need instead of hallucinating.
* **Capability**: Models can take actions in the real world through well-defined interfaces.
* **Customization**: Applications can guide model behavior through structured prompts.
* **Interoperability**: A standard protocol works across different models and applications.
* **Type Safety**: Strong typing for context and data across the protocol.
* **Pythonic**: With FastMCP, build servers using intuitive Python patterns.
* **Development Simplicity**: Streamlined testing and debugging with built-in tools.

Running MCP Servers
----------------

There are three main ways to use your MCP server:

1. **Development Mode**: Test with the MCP Inspector web interface (``mcp dev server.py``)
2. **Claude Desktop Integration**: Add to Claude Desktop for regular use (``mcp install server.py``)
3. **Direct Execution**: Run standalone for custom deployments (``python server.py``)
